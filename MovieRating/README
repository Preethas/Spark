With movielense dataset of 100k
 
http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

The u.data has the following data 
user id | item id | rating | timestamp. 
 
Write a map-reduce code to get the minimum time between two ratings of a movie by a user, maximum time between two rating of movies. 
 
A user can rate a moving only once and there are many users giving rating to a movie at different point in time. We interested in finding:
1) At user level: For each user, what is minimum & maximum time gap between the ratings given for the movies
i.e.: (U1, min(t2-t1, t3-t2, t4-t3,t5-t4), max(t2-t1, t3-t2, t4-t3,t5-t4))
 
2) At movie level: For each movie, what is minimum & maximum time gap between the ratings given by the users
i.e.: (M1, min(t2-t1, t3-t2, t4-t3,t5-t4), max(t2-t1, t3-t2, t4-t3,t5-t4))
